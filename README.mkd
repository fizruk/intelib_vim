Vim files for InteLib
=====================

Syntax files for InteLib Lisp are included in C++ syntax file as follows:

    syn include @ilisp $HOME/.vim/syntax/ilisp.vim
    syn region intelibLispRegion start=+(L|+ end=+)+ contains=intelibLispRegion,@ilisp

So you can use your own C++ syntax file and just include these two
lines to add InteLib Lisp highlighting.

Have fun!
